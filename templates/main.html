<p class="houseTitle">Main House </p>
<p class="text">  In 1897, Leila and John R. Mott (a Nobel Peace Prize winner later in life) were invited to Lac des Iles by a friend and colleague. In 1899, they built a summer house on land given to them by D.W. Ross, another friend who appreciated the work being done by J.R. Mott, and who had built the first house on the lake, just across the bay.   
The original log house burned down in 1951 and was replaced in 1952.   The "new" house is spacious and in a prime location on the lake,   with such conveniences as two bathrooms, well-equipped kitchen,   electric stove, washer and dryer. The house is not winter-tight but is   comfortable from May through September, with first-floor insulation,   fireplaces,   and baseboard heaters. </p>

<p class="text">  There are ample facilities for six people in three bedrooms, each with   two   twin beds; the master bedroom has a fireplace and its own bathroom.   There is   also a large dormitory space and play room upstairs.  In addition, there   is an adjacent   (100 yards from house) one-room log "lodge" with large fireplace and two   twin beds. </p>

<p class="text">  The living room has a fireplace and Steinway grand piano, with an offset   dining area.   A picture window in the living room looks out on the lake.  A screened   porch to the   south and an open porch to the north off the living room also provide   nice views of   woods and lake. The house is equipped with blankets, but family and friends are   expected to   provide their own sheets and towels. There are two yards, one sloping   down to the   water and a small sandy beach with adjacent large wharf and another yard   on north side of   house approximately the size of a tennis court.  A rowboat and at least   one canoe are provided. </p>
